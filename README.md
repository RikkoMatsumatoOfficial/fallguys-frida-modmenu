# Fall Guys Frida Mod Menu
Android Fall Guys cheat using [Frida](https://frida.re/) and [frida-il2cpp-bridge](https://github.com/vfsfitvnm/frida-il2cpp-bridge)

## Message To MediaTonic 
Please, Fix the game. You've had over a year to fix the many bugs and the bad optimization on consoles (Switch, Xbox, PS) makes it unplayable. It's time to focus on the state of the game.

## Features  
- Bypass character physics checks
- Change speed 
- Change velocity / No velocity / Negative velocity 
- 360 Dives 
- Teleport To Finish (Only Races)
- FPS Bypass 
- FPS Counter

## Troubleshooting 
**HyperOS**, **ColorOS**, **HarmonyOS** and other **OEM ROMs** may not work properly <br>
Restart the game if the menu disappears

## Special Thanks
[FloyzI](https://github.com/FloyzI) - for how the game works <br>
[commonuserlol](https://github.com/commonuserlol) - for help with code and [menu](https://github.com/commonuserlol/frida-java-menu)
